These are two uncompressed save game files from Civilization III Conquests. I include them because until recently my code was hard-coded to read one or the other. I may remove these soon as my code seems capable of reading arbitrary uncompressed save files. They are saved game data; to my knowledge there is no copyright or license for this data, but if there is it would belong to the game publisher.
