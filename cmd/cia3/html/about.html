        <h1>About Civ Intelligence Agency III</h1>
        <p>Civ Intelligence Agency III (CIA3) is intended to be a non-spoiling, non-cheating game assistant for single-human-player games of Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete and/or Conquests.</p>
        <p>CIA3 watches save game folder locations for new .SAV files, then reads the file and updates the information. Every time you save your game or begin a new turn, a new save or autosave will be generated and trigger CIA3 to update its info. It does not update mid-turn unless you save your game during the turn.</p>
        <p>CIA3 currently reads the Windows registry to determine the default save and autosave folders for Civ3 and watches those. In the future I'll add the ability to watch specified folders and perhaps open files on demand.</p>
        <p>The information provided by CIA3 is either available in-game, was available earlier in-game or during map creation, or accepted as not cheating by Civ III competitions. For example, the player may not be able to determine in-game if forests have been previously chopped for shield production on newly-revealed map tiles, but previous assistants (CivAssist II) have shown this information and have been allowed in competitive games. Another example is that previous tools allowed exact map tile counts when at least 80% of the map is revealed to allow for determining how far the player is from winning by domination.</p>
        <p>Previous assistants such as <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/crpsuite-2-11-0.16266/" target="_blank">CRpSuite's MapStat</a> <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/crpsuite-2-11-0.16266/" target="_blank">(download page)</a> and <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civassist-ii.118540/" target="_blank">CivAsist II</a> <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/civassist-ii.21/" target="_blank">(download page)</a> worked well for many years, but neither of these seem to work in Windows 10.</p>
        <p>I, Jim Nelson, or <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/members/puppeteer.36357/" target="_blank">Puppeteer on CivFanatics Forums</a>, have been on-and-off since 2013 been working on a save game reader for other purposes with <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civ3-show-and-tell.493582/" target="_blank">Civ3 Show-And-Tell</a> (C3SAT). Until 2020 I explicitly did <strong>not</strong> want to recreate a game assistant, but now that the others aren't working and seem to be abandoned by their creators, I started working on CIA3 from the C3SAT code base. CIA3 is a different product from C3SAT, but they share a common code base for most functions.</p>
