# clua - Civ3 Lua

This commmand started as a wholesale copy from <https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua/blob/master/cmd/glua/glua.go>.
It behaves much like the native lua executable. The magic is in the modules for
Civ III which are under development.

See the scripts in /\_lua\_examples/ to use with this.

e.g. `clua ../../_lua_examples/textmap.lua`
