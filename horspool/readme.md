horspool.py by [Kamran Khan](http://inspirated.com/about) is code I found to search a stream for a string match. I am using it to skip to the first "WRLD" section in the save game. I obtained this code from http://inspirated.com/2010/06/19/using-boyer-moore-horspool-algorithm-on-file-streams-in-python .
