Civ3 Show-And-Tell

Tagged previous effort as 0.1 and created a develop branch. I now want
to store the game data in a database, so there will be code to read
the game file and insert data into a database, and then any spoiler,
map or report logic will happen after that. I also want a REST API for
accessing data from the DB.

Things are about to get broken in the develop branch.
