This folder copied from https://github.com/arkelee/civ3 .  I decided to
copy rather than fork because it's mostly documentation, and the project
seems abandoned so I don't expect to make any pull requests against it.

Also, I removed any binary files since I have my own save files and
tools I use.

At first glance, I wonder if most of this is copied straight from Apolyton at
