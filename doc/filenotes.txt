While dividing this it occurs to me that since GAME is used in different contexts/scopes that other terms may be reused in different scopes, so for example repeats of WRLD and CITY may be in different levels of the hierarchy

CIV3 - This may be the parent for the entire file, or maybe it's just
   a file header. The difference probably isn't important. If it's a
   parent of only part of the file it could be challenging to figure
   out where the demarc is.
BIC  - Top tier parent?
  BICQ
  GAME
GAME - Guessing 2nd appearance of GAME is top-tier parent -- OR -- maybe it is settings
  DATE
  PLGI
  DATE - this instance had a length that fell just short of CNSL
-- suspected data padding here length 8 bytes, or perhaps a simple data member of parent --
CNSL - Based on some I/O errors referring to this, I now wonder if this
   is a parent container that includes buildings, meaning it would be
   the parent of the map and much else, too
  WRLD
  WRLD
  TILE - Tons of these; map data
  CONT - continents, I presume, several occur
-- suspected padding or simple data here --
  LEAD - LEAD, CULT and 2x ESPN cycle many times
    CULT
    ESPN 
    ESPN 
  UNIT - many UNIT, IDLS cycling
    IDLS
  CITY - repetition of this term makes me wonder if there could be e.g. a CITY/CITY hierarchy with different scopes having differen meanings
  CITY
  CITY - City name is under this instance
    POPD
      CTZN - repeated for each citizen? Each one has description e.g. "Happy Laborer (England)"
      CTZN
      CTZN
    BINF - Bin full? .. Duh, probably Bin Food
    BITM
    DATE - Date city founded?
? CITY
? CTPG - seem to be two of these per city name
? CITY
? CITY Lots of repeated CITY's without the other sections
  CLNY - presumed colony info, only one CLNY in my sample file
  PALV - ? repeated
  HIST - ? not repeated
  TUTR - ? Suggests tutorial info; not repeated
  FAXXX - Not sure if this is a FAXX section or random data that looks like a string
  RPLS - not repeated, clearly a parent item
    RPLT - repeated
    RPLE - repeated, occasionally city names associated in runs of RPLE's; sometimes RPLT's resume after city name, sometimes not ; saw one great wonder name among the RPLE's to my surprise
  RPLT
?  PEER - not repeated ; multiplayer-related?
