# Dev Notes

These are notes for myself and various bits of experimental, temporary, or
old code.

It is not at all organized or polish for others, but in this repository is the
best place for me to keep track of it.

(And then I started renaming, moving folders, and adding readme.md's to make the
content more clear...well, it's still *mostly* unpolished for others.)
